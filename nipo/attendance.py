#Attendance class will do the following:
#->Check whether there is a class (from Google/any other calendar)
#->Mark a particular student present
#->Persist attendance records to db (current strategy is to serialise/pickle a 2D list and store it as a blob in the db)
#->Display attendance records for a particular module
#->Display the attendance record for a particular student

#The nipo calendar is here(https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/1?cid=ODBmc2g3ajllMjg5amYybGJuYThmODk2dDBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ). It is a Google calendar where when you invite it to any events it is ging to accept given that this event doesnt clash with anything else on its calendar. This will be the default calendar that'll be used for timetabling in this project.
