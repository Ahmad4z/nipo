A classroom (or any other room) attendance tracker that uses facial recognition

This is a very new project so the Readme is currently super sketchy. However, I am trying to ensure it contains the info necessary at ths point. I am huge on documentation so be sure that as it takes shape it will be documented extensively.

## Tools to install
1. [Git]() *Sorry I am being so obvious*
1. [Python3]()
1. [Postgresql]() *Use pip to install this*
1. Face_recognition () *See the module's READMe.md for installation instructions*
1. [Virtualenv (recommended)]()
