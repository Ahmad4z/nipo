# nipo
A classroom (or any other room) attendance tracker that uses facial recognition

This is a very new project so the Readme is currently super sketchy. However, I am trying to ensure it contains the info necessary at ths point. I am huge on documentation so be sure that as it takes shape it will be documented extensively.

## Tools to install
1. [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) *Sorry I am being so obvious*
1. [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
	* Also a [Useful section on understanding roles and users in postgres](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-roles-and-manage-grant-permissions-in-postgresql-on-a-vps--2#how-to-log-in-as-a-different-user-in-postgresql)

1. sqlalchemy >Terminal/cmd command *pip install sqlalchemy*

## After installation
After installing these tools, on your terminal, cd into the place where you would like your local copy of nipo to reside (you don't need to create a directory, one will be created for you) then 
> git clone https://github.com/mcflyhalf/nipo
This should copy all the contents of the nipo repository into a new folder called nipo on your system.
